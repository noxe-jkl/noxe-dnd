**Note: This is a living document, and all rules here are subject to change.**

These are the homebrew rules I use across my campaigns. I had used different rules for different tables, but I've started to confuse them, so I'm converging all of them into this one document. Some are my own, some are adapted from others. 

# Critical Hits

When you score a **critical hit**, you maximize the damage dice before rolling. This means:

- Roll all damage dice for the attack as normal.
- Add the **maximum possible result** of those dice to the total.

For example, if you land a critical hit with a weapon that normally deals **2d6 damage**, you would:

- **Maximize one set of dice**: 6 + 6 = 12
- **Roll the other set**: (e.g., 2d6 rolls a 4 and a 5)
- **Total damage**: 12 + 4 + 5 = **21**, plus any modifiers.

This applies to all sources of critical damage, including spells and class features.

_As an addendum to this, rolling a 20 on a skill check is a guaranteed success, as I will only ask for a roll if there is a chance for success._

# Healing Potions

Drinking a healing potion yourself can be done as either a bonus action or an action. If taken as a bonus action, you must roll for the amount healed. If taken as an action, you receive the full possible healing amount without rolling.

Administering a potion to another creature always requires an action, regardless of the method, and you must roll for the amount healed.

The exact healing values of potions remain unchanged unless modified by other rules or effects.

# Double Falling

You take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every **5 feet** fallen. The creature lands prone unless it avoids taking damage from the fall. If you jump **willingly**, you roll 4d6 fewer dice when determining fall damage.

# Inspiration 

### Heroic Inspiration

Heroic Inspiration is awarded for good roleplay and cool moments. Heroic inspiration works as written in D&D 5.5e, with the addition that players may award inspiration **to each other**, should they see it fit. However, the DM has the right to veto this if it is misused or given frivolously. 

### Historic Inspiration

Historic Inspiration is awarded when a player character plays a direct role in a significant, lasting event, something that will be remembered in history. If a player is responsible for such a moment, they receive a "**Historic Inspiration**" coupon as a tangible reward. This does not expire, and a player may only have one coupon at a given time.

A player can redeem a Heroic Inspiration coupon at any time before making a d20 test. Instead of rolling, they automatically score a **Natural 20**. 

# Permanent Injury

In certain situations, a character may face a fate where death is mechanically imminent, but the player or story is not ready to lose that character. Instead of dying, the character can suffer a **Permanent Injury** that drastically impacts their capabilities while still allowing them to continue adventuring.

## **Triggering Permanent Injury**

This rule applies when a character’s **hit points** reach **0**, and they would normally face death (i.e., failing death saving throws). Instead of dying, the player may choose to take a **Permanent Injury**. The **DM** and player must agree on this decision, and the injury must come with significant mechanical consequences.

# Excursion Resting
A **short rest** can be taken over the course of 4 hours, during which:

- At least **2 hours must be spent sleeping**.
- Up to **2 hours may be spent in light activity**, such as keeping watch, reading, or casual conversation.

A rest is interrupted if any of the following occur:

- Rolling **initiative**.
- Casting a spell that **expends a spell slot**.
- Taking **any damage**.

A **long rest** is achieved by either:

- Completing **three consecutive short rests** in the same location **without interruption**.
- Resting for a single night in a **safe haven**.

#### Safe Haven Definition:

A **safe haven** is any **secure and restful** location where a character can fully recover without reasonable fear of attack or interruption. This could be:

- A safe inn or tavern in a population center.
- A hidden sanctuary blessed or warded against intrusion.
- A well-guarded camp in an exceptionally defensible position.
- The player's home base

The DM has final discretion over what qualifies as a safe haven.

# Downtime Projects/Training

Certain tasks, such as crafting, repairing, research, or training, require extended periods of effort. The **Downtime Projects** system allows players to tackle these tasks by assigning a **time requirement (in hours)** and a **difficulty (DC)**.

## **Working on a Downtime Job**

For each **8-hour work period**, the player makes a skill check using an appropriate ability. The skill used must make sense for the task, and the DM has final approval.

- **If the check meets or exceeds the DC**, the player makes a **breakthrough**, and their 8 hours count as **16 hours** toward completing the task.
- **If the check fails**, only 8 hours are counted.
- Players may work more than 8 hours in a day, making additional checks at the DM’s discretion.

### **Setting the Task’s Difficulty & Time**

The DM determines how long a task takes and how difficult it is.

- **Time Required:** A task is assigned a **total number of hours** needed to complete it.
- **DC:** The difficulty of the task is set based on complexity, materials, and required expertise.

### **Example Tasks & Difficulty**

| Task                       | Time Required | DC  | Prerequisites                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------- | --- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Repairing a broken firearm | 100 hours     | 15  | Access to tools and spare parts               |
| Writing a history book     | 150 hours     | 12  | A blank book and access to research materials |
| Incorporating a business   | 80 hours      | 16  | Legal documents from a previous lawyer        |

### **Rewards & Completion**

Once the required hours are met, the task is finished, and the player receives their reward—whether it's a working firearm, a completed book, or an additional proficiency.

This system allows players to engage in meaningful downtime activities while ensuring progress is both structured and rewarding.

# **Travel & Journey Rules (WIP)**

A journey consists of **four phases**:

1. **Embarkation** – The party plans their route, assigns roles, and determines the journey’s difficulty.
2. **Travel** – The party faces challenges, including weather, exhaustion, and encounters.
3. **Arrival** – The group reaches their destination, resolving any final obstacles or lingering effects.
4. **Reflection** – The party assesses the journey’s toll, gaining insight or suffering fatigue based on their success.

---

## **Journey Roles**

Each character must take on one of the following roles. If a role isn’t filled, the party automatically fails any related checks when the situation arises. A character can take on two roles, but they suffer **disadvantage** on both.

- **Guide** – Leads the journey and determines the route. If following a well-traveled road, the Guide automatically succeeds. (Uses **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)**)
- **Scout** – Moves ahead to identify dangers, find shortcuts, and track threats. (Uses **Wisdom (Perception)** or **Dexterity (Stealth)**)
- **Quartermaster** – Manages rations, supplies, and logistics (such as food, light, or shelter). (Uses **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Survival)**)
- **Lookout** – Keeps watch for potential dangers and ensures the party isn’t caught off guard. (Uses **Wisdom (Perception)**)

If there are unassigned characters, they may **help** another role once per journey.

---

## **Journey Progress & Challenges**

The **Guide** makes a navigation check at the start of the journey:

- **Success:** The party earns **2 Progress Points** toward their destination.
- **Success by 5 or more:** The party earns **3 Progress Points**.
- **Failure:** The party earns **1 Progress Point** and experiences a journey event.
- **Failure by 5 or more:** The party earns **0 Progress Points** and experiences an immediate event.

Each journey has a **progress threshold** that determines how many points are required to complete it.

After each navigation check, a **random event** occurs. The **DM rolls a d20**:

|Roll|Event Type|Event Description|
|---|---|---|
|**1**|**Ambush!**|A hostile creature or group attacks. Roll initiative immediately.|
|**2**|**Bandits or Predators**|A group of outlaws or a dangerous beast is stalking the party. A successful Stealth, Survival, or Deception check may allow an escape or ambush. Failure leads to combat.|
|**3**|**Natural Hazard**|A dangerous natural obstacle (landslide, river crossing, quicksand, sudden storm) requires a group check to overcome. Failure results in injury or lost supplies.|
|**4**|**Lost the Path**|The Guide must make a Survival or Nature check. On failure, the journey takes longer, adding an extra day and requiring more rations.|
|**5**|**Supplies Spoiled**|The Quartermaster discovers that some rations or important supplies have been ruined. The party must forage or go hungry.|
|**6**|**Exhausting Terrain**|Rough terrain forces the party to exert more effort. All travelers must make a Constitution save (DC 12) or gain **one level of exhaustion**.|
|**7**|**Mysterious Remains**|The party finds the remains of a past traveler, caravan, or adventurer. Loot, a clue, or a hidden danger may be present.|
|**8**|**Crossroads Decision**|The party comes across a fork in the path. One route is safer but longer, the other is more direct but riskier. The Guide makes the final call.|
|**9**|**Tense Encounter**|The party meets another group of travelers. Are they friendly, neutral, or hostile? A Persuasion, Insight, or Intimidation check may determine the outcome.|
|**10**|**Unexpected Weather**|Sudden rain, fog, or extreme cold forces the party to slow down. The journey takes an extra day unless the Quartermaster finds a way to adapt.|
|**11**|**Hunting Grounds**|The party stumbles into a predator’s hunting area. A Stealth or Animal Handling check might avoid a dangerous encounter.|
|**12**|**Strange Phenomenon**|Unusual sounds, lights, or magical disturbances unsettle the group. A successful Arcana, Religion, or Insight check reveals more. Failure causes unease or minor magical effects.|
|**13**|**Shortcut Found**|The Scout spots a way to cut time off the journey. A skill check (Survival, Perception, or Investigation) can reduce travel time.|
|**14**|**Hidden Resource**|The party finds fresh water, edible plants, or an abandoned camp with useful supplies.|
|**15**|**Ruins or Relics**|The party stumbles upon ancient ruins or a strange monument. Investigating may yield knowledge, clues, or a minor trinket but carries a small risk.|
|**16**|**Quiet Day**|The journey continues without trouble, but no progress is gained beyond the standard rate.|
|**17**|**Safe Haven**|The party finds a secure place to rest—an abandoned cabin, cave, or friendly outpost. Taking a long rest here **removes one level of exhaustion**.|
|**18**|**Valuable Discovery**|The party finds something valuable—a rare herb, a minor magical item, or lost treasure. The Quartermaster rolls to determine its usefulness.|
|**19**|**Guiding Spirits**|A sign, vision, or strange event gives insight into the road ahead. The Guide rolls with **advantage on their next check**.|
|**20**|**Fortuitous Circumstances**|Luck is on the party’s side! They bypass a future encounter, recover lost supplies, or arrive earlier than expected.|

## **Journey Difficulty Table**

| Terrain Type        | Base DC | Travel Speed Adjustment |
| ------------------- | ------- | ----------------------- |
| Roads, Open Fields  | 10      | Normal Speed            |
| Hills, Light Forest | 12      | Normal Speed            |
| Heavy Forest, Swamp | 14      | -25% Speed              |
| Mountains, Desert   | 16      | -50% Speed              |
| Extreme Conditions  | 18+     | Varies                  |

**Modifiers:**

- **Poor weather**: +2 DC
- **Lack of rest**: +3 DC
- **Magical disturbances**: +4 DC

---

## **Fatigue & Exhaustion**

At the **end of the journey**, each character makes a **DC 12 Constitution saving throw** to resist fatigue.

- **Success:** No exhaustion.
- **Failure:** Gain **1 level of exhaustion**.
- **Failure by 5 or more:** Gain **2 levels of exhaustion**.

Modifiers:

- If the party had proper food, water, and shelter, they roll **with advantage**.
- If the journey was unusually harsh (e.g., extreme cold, forced marches), increase the DC.

If the party camped in the wild without tents or shelter, additional exhaustion checks may be required.

---

## **Arrival & Reflection**

Upon reaching their destination, the party reflects on the journey’s hardships and triumphs. Depending on their choices and rolls, they may arrive fatigued, or may have other boons/banes from their journey
