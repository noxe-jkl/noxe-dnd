### **Feature: Arcane Analyst**

Your work has made you adept at recognizing magical patterns, even in places where magic is scarce. You can often determine whether an effect, item, or occurrence is truly magical or merely a mundane trick with a moment of study. In settings where magic is feared or misunderstood, you can present your findings in a way that makes them more palatable to common folk or skeptics. Additionally, you have contacts among scholars, hedge wizards, and even frauds, allowing you to gather obscure information related to magic more easily.
